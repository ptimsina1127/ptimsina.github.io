Developing a library management system, you will utilize HTML to create the interface for adding, editing, and searching for books, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for managing book data and search functionality. Additional aspects like user management, book lending, and returns could be added to increase complexity. For advanced students, local storage or a backend database might be introduced to preserve data persistently.
